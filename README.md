## Course structure
This is a 6-week course that mixes independent study of online contents with in-class recitation and Python workshop. Assignments include [Kaggle Python modules](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) and analysis of public clinical datasets. Half of the course involve an active intership with the Data Team at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital where students are expected to participate in drafting solutions for real-world use cases.

### Key topics
1. Computational thinking
2. Python programming for data science
3. Machine learning
4. AI in healthcare and hospital management
